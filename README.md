# crypto sentiment analysis - frontend 

This is a personal project to gather &amp; measure sentiment from various social media / news sites and compare that to the price fluctuations of crypto currencies. This repository has the code for the plotly dash application. The backend code can be found at https://github.com/vantaka2/crypto_sentiment_analysis-


### App Hosting

I'm currently using Heroku to host the plotly dash application, you can view the current state at: 
https://crypto-sentiment-keerthan.herokuapp.com/ 

Please note I'm using the free tier.
Heroku puts the appliccation to sleep if no one views it in 30 minutes. 

The first person who views the application after it was put to sleep will see longer than normal startup time.
